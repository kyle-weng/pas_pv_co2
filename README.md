# pas_pv_co2

Most of the code I wrote during the summer of 2017 to crunch CO2 data to examine seasonal cycles @ Caltech's Department of Geological and Planetary Sciences. Data not included.

Also: Updated Model, 2004-2006 all years.py and Updated Model, 2004-2006 by year.py are from a different project (OCS uptake in Alaska), but I'm leaving them up here.
